abstract: >
    Language often has different ways to express the same or similar meanings. Despite this, however, people seem to have preferences for some ways over others. For example, people overwhelmingly prefer *bread and butter* to *butter and bread*. Previous research has demonstrated that these ordering preferences grow stronger with frequency (i.e., frequency-dependent regularization). In this paper we demonstrate that this frequency-dependent regularization can be accounted for by noisy-channel processing theories [e.g., @gibsonNoisy2013; levyNoisychannel2008]. We also show that this regularization can only be accounted for if the listener infers more noise than the speaker produces. Finally, we show that the model can account for the language distribution of binomial ordering preferences.

# Introduction

Speakers are often confronted with many different ways to express the same meaning. A customer might ask whether a store sells "radios and televisions", but they could have just as naturally asked whether the store sells "televisions and radios." However, despite conveying the same meaning, speakers sometimes have strong preferences for one choice over competing choices [e.g., preference for *men and women* over *women and men*, @benor2006; @morgan2016]. These preferences are driven to some extent by generative preferences (e.g., preference for short words before long words), however they are sometimes violated by idiosyncratic preferences [e.g., *ladies and gentlemen* preferred despite a general men-before-women generative preference, @morganFrequencydependentRegularizationIterated2016].

Interestingly, ordering preferences for certain constructions, such as binomial expressions, are often more extreme for higher frequency items (e.g., *bread and butter*). That is, higher-frequency items typically have more polarized preferences [@liu2020; @liu2021; @morganFrequencydependentRegularizationIterated2016; @morganModelingIdiosyncraticPreferences2015; @morgan2016]. This phenomenon is called *Frequency-dependent regularization*, and while there is evidence of it in several different constructions, it is still unclear what processeses this phenomenon is driven by. For example, it could be a consequence of learning processes or a consequence of sentence processing more broadly. In the present paper we examine whether a noisy-channel processing model [@gibsonNoisy2013] combined with transmission across generations [@realiEvolutionFrequencyDistributions2009] can account for frequency-dependent regularization.

## Frequency-dependent regularization

Frequency-dependent regularization has been documented for a variety of different constructions in English [@liu2020; @liu2021; @morganFrequencydependentRegularizationIterated2016; @morganModelingIdiosyncraticPreferences2015]. For example, @morganModelingIdiosyncraticPreferences2015 demonstrated that more frequent binomial expressions (e.g., *bread and butter*) are more strongly regularized (i.e., are preferred in one order overwhelmingly more than the alternative). These ordering preferences are also not simply a result of abstract ordering preferences [e.g., short words before long words, @morgan2016].

Additionally, @liu2020 demonstrated this effect holds true for the dative alternation in English (e.g., *give* *the ball to him*Â vs *give him the ball*). Specifically, they demonstrated higher frequency verbs have more polarized preferences with respect to the dative alternation. Similarly, @liu2021 showed that Adjective-Adjective-Noun orderings also show frequency-dependent regularization. That is, adjective-adjective-Nouns with higher overall frequencies show stronger ordering preferences, even after taking into account generative preferences of adjective orderings.

<!--# this bottom paragraph needs to be expanded -->

How does this polarization for high-frequency items arise? One possibility is that it occurs as a consequence of imperfect transmission between generations. For example, @morganFrequencydependentRegularizationIterated2016 demonstrated that in an iterated-learning paradigm [@realiEvolutionFrequencyDistributions2009], this frequency-dependent regularization can arise from an interaction between a frequency-independent bias and transmission across generations. Specifically, they used an iterated learning paradigm [following @realiEvolutionFrequencyDistributions2009] and demonstrated that by introducing a frequency-independent regularization bias, after several generations the model predicted frequency-*dependent* regularization. However, it is unclear what process in language is analogous to the frequency-independent bias.

## Noisy-channel Processing

One possibility is that frequency-dependent regularization arises as a product of noisy-channel processing [@gibsonNoisy2013]. Listeners are confronted with a great deal of noise in the form of perception errors (e.g., a noisy environment) and even production errors [speakers don't always say what they intended to, @gibsonNoisy2013]. In order to overcome these errors, a processing system must take into account the noise of the system.

Indeed, there is evidence that our processing system does take noise into account. For example, @ganongPhoneticCategorizationAuditory1980 found that people will process a non-word as being a word under noisy conditions. Additionally, @feltyMisperceptionsSpokenWords demonstrated that when listeners do misperceive a word, the word that they believe to have heard tends to be higher frequency than the target word. Further, @keshevNoisyBetterRare2021 found that in Arabic, readers will even process ambiguous subject/object relative clauses as the more frequent interpretation, even if this interpretation compromises subject-verb agreement. These results taken together suggests that misperceptions may sometimes actually be a consequence of noisy-channel processing (rather than a failure of our perceptual system).[^1]

[^1]: Though it is worth noting that good enough processing theories can also account for many of these results [@ferreiraGoodEnoughApproach2007].

In order to account for findings like these, @gibsonNoisy2013 developed a computational model that demonstrated how a system might take into account noise [see @levyNoisychannel2008 for a similar approach]. Specifically, their model operationalizes noisy-channel processing as a Bayesian process where a listener estimates the probability that their perception matches the speaker's intended utterance. Specifically, this is operationlized as being proportional to the prior probability of the intended utterance multiplied by the probability of the intended utterance being corrupted to the perceived utterance (See Equation \ref{eq:gibsonnoisy}):

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:gibsonnoisy}
P(S_i|S_p) \propto P(S_i) P(S_i \to S_p)
\end{equation}
```
where $P(S_i|S_p)$ is the probability that the intended utterance was actually the utterance that was perceived, $P(S_i)$ is the prior probability of the intended utterance, and $P(S_i \to S_p)$ is the probability that the intended utterance was corrupted by noise.

@gibsonNoisy2013's model made a variety of interesting predictions. For example, the model predicted that when people are presented with an implausible sentence (e.g., *the mother gave the candle the daughter*), they should be more likely to interpret the plausible version of the sentence (e.g., *the mother gave the candle to the daughter*) if there is increased noise (e.g., by adding syntactic errors to the filler items, such as a deleted function word). Their model also predicted that increasing the likelihood of implausible events (e.g., by adding more filler items that were implausible, such as *the girl was kicked by the ball*) should increase the rate of implausible interpretations of the sentence. Interestingly both of these results were born out in their experimental data, suggesting that humans do utilize a noisy-channel system in processing.

## Present Study

Given the evidence of noisy-channel processing, it is possible that the frequency-dependent regularization that @morganFrequencydependentRegularizationIterated2016 saw is a product of listeners' noisy-channel processing. That is, perhaps the regularization bias responsible for the regularization across generations is a consequence of noisy-channel processing. Thus, the present study examines whether @gibsonNoisy2013's noisy-channel processing model can also predict frequency-dependent regularization across generations of language transmission.

# Dataset

Following @morganFrequencydependentRegularizationIterated2016, we use @morganModelingIdiosyncraticPreferences2015's corpus of 594 binomial expressions. This corpus has been annotated for various phonological, semantic, and lexical constraints that are known to affect binomial ordering preferences. The corpus also includes estimated generative preferences for each binomial, which are the ordering preferences estimated from the above constraints (e.g., preference for short before long). Additionally, it contains the observed binomial orderings preferences (hereafter: observed preferences) which are the proportion of binomial orderings that are in alphabetical form for a given binomial. A visualization of the distribution of observed preferences and compositional preferences is included below in Figure \ref{fig:corpusplot1}, on the left and right respectively.

# Model

Following @morganFrequencydependentRegularizationIterated2016, we use a 2-alternative iterated learning paradigm. A learner hears N tokens of a binomial expression and then produces N tokens for the next generation. After hearing N tokens, they infer the probability, $S_i$, of the alphabetical form of the binomial. Using that probability, they then produce N tokens for the next generation, and this process continues iteratively.

The prior probability of a binomial's ordering is operationalized using the beta distribution [following @morganFrequencydependentRegularizationIterated2016]. Specifically, we treat the generative preference for a given binomial as the prior for our model. This is operationalized using the beta distribution with $\mu_{prior}$, which is the generative preference for a given binomial, and $\nu$, which determines the strength of the belief of the prior probability. Thus the prior probability for a given binomial in its alphabetical form is estimated as:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:thetaPrior}
P(\theta_{prior}) = \frac{\mu_{prior} \cdot \nu}{(\mu_{prior} \cdot \nu) + \nu(1 - \mu_{prior})}
\end{equation}
```
and the probability of hearing it in non-alphabetical form is $1-P(\theta_{prior})$.

This is then used as the prior in @gibsonNoisy2013's noisy-channel processing model, such that if a listener hears the alphabetical form of a binomial they update the probability of hearing it in alphabetical form according to the following parametrization,

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:phatAlpha}
\hat{p}(\alpha) \propto \frac{\mu_{prior} \cdot \nu}{(\mu_{prior} \cdot \nu) + \nu(1 - \mu_{prior})} \cdot P(noise)
\end{equation}
```
where $p_{noise}$ is a fixed parameter for every binomial, representing the probability of mis-hearing a binomial expression. They also update the probability of hearing the non-alphabetical form:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:phatNonalpha}
\hat{p}(\neg\alpha) \propto 1 - \frac{\mu_{prior} \cdot \nu}{(\mu_{prior} \cdot \nu) + \nu(1 - \mu_{prior})} \cdot (1-P(noise))
\end{equation}
```
If the listener hears the non-alphabetical form of the binomial, they update using the same equations, but instead the likelihood of hearing the alphabetical form is $p(noise)$, and the likelihood of hearing the non-alphabetical form is $1-p(noise)$ (since hearing the non-alphabetical form is infact being faithful to the data in this context). Thus the estimated probability of the alphabetical form of the binomial is updated according to:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:phatAlpha2}
\hat{p}(\alpha) \propto \frac{\mu_{prior} \cdot \nu}{(\mu_{prior} \cdot \nu) + \nu(1 - \mu_{prior})} \cdot P(noise) 
\end{equation}
```
and the estimated probability of the non-alphabetical form is updated according to:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:phatNonalpha2}
\hat{p}(\neg\alpha) \propto 1 - \frac{\mu_{prior} \cdot \nu}{(\mu_{prior} \cdot \nu) + (1 - \mu_{prior}) \cdot \nu} \cdot (1-P(noise)) 
\end{equation}
```
Finally, before $\hat{p}_\alpha$ and $\hat{p}_{\neg\alpha}$ are updated, the un-normalized estimates of the alphabetical and non-alphabetical above are normalized such that they sum to 1.[^2]

[^2]: The full computational implementation can be found in the `iterated_learning.R` script in the github repository.

Once the learner finishes hearing N tokens, they then produce N tokens generated binomially, where $\theta_1$ is their inferred probability of the alphabetical form of the given binomial (which is set to 0.5 for the first generation):

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:binomialProd}
P(x_1|\theta_1) = \binom{N}{x_1} \theta^{x_1} (1-\theta_1)^{N-x_1}
\end{equation}
```
When the learner produces the N tokens, there is also a possibility the speaker will make an error. This is also generated binomially, with $\theta_1$ being a fixed parameter, which is the probability that the learner makes an error. In our model, if the learner makes an error, the opposite ordering of a given binomial is produced. For example, if the learner intends to produce *bread and butter* and makes an error, *butter and bread* is produced.

# Results

## Speaker vs Listener Noise

First we demonstrate that frequency-dependent regularization does not arise when there is no listener or speaker noise.[^3] Instead we see convergence to the prior, which is expected. That is, @griffithsLanguageEvolutionIterated2007 demonstrated that when learners sample from the posterior, as the number of iterations increases, the stationary distribution converges to the prior. In other words, without any noise, each generation of learners produces data that is more and more similar to the prior, until convergence is reached (Figure \ref{fig:noNoisePlot}).

However, when we introduce noise (Figure \ref{fig:regularizationplot1}), we see that the model can predict frequency-dependent regularization across generations.

Note how for the binomials with large N, the ordering preferences tend to be more extreme.}\label{fig:regularizationplot1}
\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

Further, the disparity of the noise affects the rate of regularization. Increased noise results in weaker regularization (i.e., less regularization for lower frequency items, see Figure \ref{fig:absolutediff}), however a larger relative difference between the speaker and listener noise parameters increases both the strength and the speed of the regularization (see Figure \ref{fig:fasterslowerreg}).

\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

Interestingly this regularization disappears if the listener's noise parameter is less than or equal to the speaker's noise parameter (Figure \ref{fig:regularizationplot2}).

Note how regularization does not appear to be present in this graph.}\label{fig:regularizationplot2}
\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

It is useful to revisit here what the speaker and listener noise parameters represent. The speaker noise parameter is how often the speaker produces an error and the listener noise parameter is the listeners' belief of how noisy the environment is. Framed this way, it is perhaps unsurprising that we do not see regularization when the parameters equal eachother, since they essentially cancel eachother out (everytime a speaker makes an error, the listener is accounting for it, thus we get convergence to the prior).

Thus our model makes a novel prediction: In order to account for frequency-dependent regularization, listeners must be inferring more noise than speakers are actually producing (according to our model).

## Corpus Data

Finally, we now demonstrate that our model also predicts the language-wide distribution of binomial preference strengths seen in the corpus data. Specifically, we show that with $\nu$ set to 10, listener noise set to 0.02, and speaker noise set to 0.005, our model does a pretty good job of approximating the distribution in the corpus data (See Figure \ref{fig:corpusourmodel}).

# Conclusion

Our results demonstrate the frequency-dependent regularization emerges from a noisy-channel processing model [@gibsonNoisy2013] in an iterative-learning paradigm [@realiEvolutionFrequencyDistributions2009] when listeners assume more noise in the environment than the speakers actually produce.

Further our results suggest that in order to account for frequency-dependent regularization, listeners are inferring more noise than speakers are producing. An interesting avenue for future research is whether this prediction is born out in experimental work.
